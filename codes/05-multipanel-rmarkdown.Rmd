## Creating Small Multiples with `facet_*()`

Faceting can be used to visualize data as small multiples, each showing a different subset of the data. Small multiples are a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis to avoid overplotting, compare many groups, and highlight differences.

![Adapted from "ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" by Hadley Wickham](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/hands-on-ggplot2/main/slides/img/position-facets.png)


The well-known plot we are going to use for our small multiples, saved as `g`:

```{r facet-no}
g <- 
  ggplot(data, aes(date, close)) +
    geom_line(
      aes(color = currency),
      size = 1
    ) +
    scale_x_date(
      date_labels = "%m/%y",
      expand = c(0, 0)
    ) +
    scale_y_continuous(
      labels = scales::dollar_format()
    ) +
    scale_color_brewer(
      palette = "Set1",
      guide = "none"
    )

g
```

### `facet_wrap()`

`facet_wrap()` splits the data into small multiples based on **one grouping variable**:

```{r facet-wrap-year}
g +
  facet_wrap(vars(year))
```

```{r facet-wrap-currency}
g +
  facet_wrap(vars(currency))
```

```{r facet-wrap-currency-2}
g +
  facet_wrap(~ currency)
```

```{r facet-wrap-scales-free}
g +
  facet_wrap(
    vars(currency),
    scales = "free"
  )
```

```{r facet-wrap-scales-free-y}
g +
  facet_wrap(
    vars(currency),
    scales = "free_y"
  )
```

```{r facet-wrap-nrow}
g +
  facet_wrap(
    vars(currency),
    nrow = 1
  )
```

```{r facet-wrap-ncol}
g +
  facet_wrap(
    vars(currency),
    ncol = 1
  )
```

### `facet_grid()`

`facet_grid()` spans a grid of each combination of **two grouping variables**:

```{r facet-grid}
g +
  facet_grid(
    cols = vars(currency),
    rows = vars(year)
  )
```

```{r facet-grid-2}
g +
  facet_grid(
    year ~ currency
  )
```

```{r facet-grid-2-inv}
g +
  facet_grid(
    currency ~ year
  )
```

```{r facet-grid-inv-scales}
g +
  facet_grid(
    currency ~ year,
    scales = "free"
  )
```

```{r facet-grid-inv-scales-y}
g +
  facet_grid(
    currency ~ year,
    scales = "free_y"
  )
```

## Exercise 1:

* A famous statistical data set is the [“Datasaurus Dozen”](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html), which is based on [“Anscome's Quartet”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet).<br><br>Import the according data into R and inspect it: `datasaurus.csv`
* Visualize all 12 sets as small multiples of scatter plots.
* Also, add to each facet a linear fitting in the back.
* Use a built-in theme and add a title and explanation of the visual.

## Create Plot Compositions with the `patchwork` Package

![Illustration by Allison Horst](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/hands-on-ggplot2/main/slides/img/ah_patchwork.jpg)

Build up your multipanel plot sequentially using **The Composer of Plots**:

```{r patchwork-basic-plots}
(time <- ggplot(data, aes(date, close)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = currency)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1",
                     guide = "none"))

(box <- ggplot(data, aes(currency, close)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = currency)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1",
                     guide = "none"))
```

```{r patchwork-plots-composed}
#install.packages("patchwork")
library(patchwork)

time + box
```

```{r patchwork-plots-divided}
time / box
```

With the help of `plot_layout()` you can adjust widths and/or heights:

```{r patchwork-widths}
time + box + 
  plot_layout(widths = c(2, 1))
```

The `plot_spacer()` function allows to add empty panels:

```{r patchwork-spacer, fig.width=14, fig.height=5.4}
time + plot_spacer() + box + 
  plot_layout(widths = c(2, .5, 1))
```

Let's add another plot — with parentheses you can nest plots:

```{r patchwork-adv}
scatter <-
  ggplot(data,
         aes(close, open)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = currency),
    size = 1.5,
    alpha = .25
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(
    palette = "Set1",
    guide = "none"
  )

time / (box + scatter) +
  plot_layout(heights = c(1, 2))
```

Note that even with legends the plot panels align:

```{r patchwork-adv-legend}
scatter_guide <-
  ggplot(data,
         aes(close, open)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = currency),
    size = 1.5,
    alpha = .25
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(
    palette = "Set1",
    #guide = "none"
  )

time / (box + scatter_guide) +
  plot_layout(heights = c(1, 2))
```

The argument `guides = "collect"` groups legends and places them relative to the composition:

```{r patchwork-adv-legend-collect}
time / (box + scatter_guide) +
  plot_layout(
    heights = c(1, 2),
    guides = "collect"
  )
```

Furthermore, `plot_annotation()` allows to add labels on the compositional level:

```{r patchwork-annotate}
time / (box + scatter_guide) +
  plot_layout(
    heights = c(1, 2),
    guides = "collect"
  ) +
  plot_annotation(
    title = "Performance of Top 4 Cryptocurrencies"
  )
```

`plot_annotation()` also comes with the functionality to tag panels in one step:

```{r patchwork-annotate-2}
time / (box + scatter_guide) +
  plot_layout(
    heights = c(1, 2),
    guides = "collect"
  ) +
  plot_annotation(
    title = "Performance of Top 4 Cryptocurrencies",
    tag_levels = "A",
    tag_suffix = ")"
  )
```

```{r patchwork-annotate-3}
time / (box + scatter_guide) +
  plot_layout(
    heights = c(1, 2),
    guides = "collect"
  ) +
  plot_annotation(
    title = "Performance of Top 4 Cryptocurrencies",
    tag_levels = "i",
    tag_prefix = "(",
    tag_suffix = ")"
  )
```

`{patchwork}` also allows to place plots as insets:

```{r patchwork-inset}
box <- box + 
  theme(plot.background = element_blank())

scatter +
  inset_element(
    box, 
    top = .55,
    right = 1, 
    bottom = 0,
    left = .6
  )
```

```{r patchwork-inset-2}
box <- box + 
  theme(panel.background = element_blank())

scatter +
  inset_element(
    box, 
    top = .9,
    right = .9,
    bottom = .1,
    left = .1
  )
```
