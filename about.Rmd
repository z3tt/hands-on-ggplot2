**Cédric is a graduated computational ecologist with a passion for design. In 2020, he combined his expertise in analyzing and visualizing large data sets in R with his passion to become a freelance data visualization specialist.**

Cédric has created visualizations across all disciplines, purposes, and styles and regularly teaches data visualization principles, R, and ggplot2. Due to regular participation to social data challenges, he is now well known for complex and visually appealing figures, entirely made with ggplot2, that look as they have been created with a vector design tool.
